# **Auth-Service with Node.js**

Welcome to the **Auth-Service** project! This is a lightweight Node.js application that serves as an authentication landing page. It features a visually appealing interface, complete with a greeting page and responsive navigation.

## **Features**
- **Responsive UI**: A modern, clean, and responsive landing page built with Bootstrap.
- **Authentication Routes**: Basic `/login` and `/register` endpoints for handling user data (extendable to real-world use cases).
- **Database Ready**: Easily connect to a MongoDB or PostgreSQL database for storing user credentials.
- **Static File Serving**: CSS and JavaScript files are served for enhanced design and interactivity.

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for building fast, scalable applications.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for handling routes and middleware.
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend library for responsive and styled components.
- **CSS & JavaScript**: For custom styling and interactivity.

```
auth-service/
├── public/             # Contains static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── styles.css  # Custom CSS for styling
│   ├── js/

├── app.js              # Main server file
├── package.json        # Node.js configuration and dependencies
```

---

## **API Endpoints**
- **GET `/`**: Serves the landing page.
- **POST `/login`**: Accepts a username and password for basic login (expandable for real authentication workflows).
- **POST `/register`**: Allows user registration (requires database integration).

## **Future Enhancements**
Some ideas to expand this project:
1. **Token-based Authentication**:
   - Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user sessions.
2. **Database Integration**:
   - Store user credentials in a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
3. **Advanced UI**:
   - Add animations, forms, and additional pages for a complete web experience.
4. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement proper error handling with meaningful error messages.
